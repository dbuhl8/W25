What is a fluid?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Its flows! 
    \item it deforms continuously
\end{itemize}

Categorization of fluids:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compressible v. incompressible
    \item viscous v. inviscid
    \item + many more
\end{itemize}

{\Large \textbf{Mass Conservation}}
\vspace{5pt}


In order to conserve mass we consider an arbitrary eularian volume (i.e. the
volume doesn't move with the flow). We then find the total mass which is equal
to the integral of the density over the volume, and then consider the flux of
mass through the boundary (change in mass over time). Using the divergence
theorem, we then have a conservation equation for mass. 

\begin{gather*}
    \ppt{}\int_D\rho dV = \int_{\partial D} \rho\uvec \cdot \eta dA\\
    \ppt{\rho} + \grad\cdot \rho\uvec = 0 \\
    \ppt{\rho} + \uvec\cdot\grad\rho + \rho\grad\cdot\uvec = 0\\
    \frac{D\rho}{Dt} = - \rho \grad\cdot\uvec
\end{gather*}

More importantly, if we consider an incompressible fluid, i.e. $\rho = \rho_0$,
we have very specifically,
\begin{gather}
    \grad \cdot \uvec = 0
\end{gather}


\vspace{20pt}
{\Large \textbf{Stresses}}
\vspace{5pt}

Stresses can be divided into two catagories, body forces and surface forces.
Body forces are forces such as gravity and the electric force, which surface forces are
forces such as normal force and friction. 

\vspace{20pt}
{\Large \textbf{Newtons Second Law}}
\vspace{5pt}
Newton's second law 
\begin{gather*}
    \ppt{p} = \sum_i F_i
\end{gather*}
where $p$ here is the momentum of a fluid parcel. In actuality, the momentum can
be written as $p = \int_D \rho\uvec dV$. So, 
\begin{gather*}
    \DDt{}\int_D \rho\uvec dV = \int_D \rho \bs{g} dV + (\text{other body
    forces}) + \grad \cdot \bs{\tau}\\
    \rho\DDt{\uvec} = \rho F + \grad\cdot\bs{\tau}
\end{gather*}
where $\bs{\tau}$ is the stress tensor acting on the fluid parcel. Surface
forces are then introduced into this stress tensor. First and foremost, surface
pressure is introduced along the stress tensor. 
\begin{gather*}
    \tau_{ij} = -p\delta_{ij} + \sigma_{ij}
\end{gather*}
where $\sigma_{ij}$ is the deviatoric stress tensor and is responsible for the
off-diagonal components of the stress tensor. Some components are the velocity
gradient tensors, $\ppxj{u_i}$ and $\ppxi{u_j}$. Each of these has a symmetric
compoenent and an antisymmetric componenet. 
\begin{gather*}
    \ppxj{u_i} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\ppxj{u_i} + \ppxi{u_j}\right) +
    \frac{1}{2}\left(\ppxj{u_i} - \ppxi{u_j}\right)
\end{gather*}
The first term is labeled symmetric and denoted $e_{ij}$ while the second
component is the rotation componenet.

\section*{Lecture 3: Continuing Review of the Kinematic Equations}

\subsection{Obtaining the Navier-Stokes equation}

Decomposition of the deviatoric stress tensor reveals a 4th order tensor with 81
components.
\begin{gather*}
    \bs{\sigma}_{ij} = \bs{A}_{ijkl}\bs{e}_{kl}
\end{gather*}
In order to reduce the complexity of the system, we make some assumptions about
the tensor $\bs{A}_{ijkl}$. First, we state that this tensor must be isotropic,
i.e. that it doesn't care about the direction of the stress with respect to the
coordinate system it is in. We have, 
\begin{gather*}
    \bs{A}_{ijkl} = \mu \bs{\delta}_{ij}\bs{\delta}_{kl} +
    \mu'\bs{\delta}_{ik}\bs{\delta}_{jl} +
    \mu''\bs{\delta}_{il}\bs{\delta}_{jk}
\end{gather*}
Next, we assume that this tensor must be symmetric. This reduces the complexity
down to two coefficients, $\mu$, the viscosity, and $\mu'$ which is the bulk viscosity. 

In order to obtain the Navier-Stokes equation, we require the Stokes assumption
which postulates that the diagonal components of the deviatoric stress tensor
are zero, i.e. $\bs{\sigma}_{ii} = 0$. 
\begin{gather*}
    \bs{\sigma}_{ij} = 2\mu\left(\bs{e}_{ij} -
    \frac{1}{3}\left(\grad\cdot\uvec\right)\bs{\delta}_{ij}\right)    \\
    \bs{\tau}_{ij} = -p\bs{\delta}_{ij} + 2\mu\left(\bs{e}_{ij} -
    \frac{1}{3}\left(\grad \cdot \uvec\right)\bs{\delta}_{ij}\right)
\end{gather*}
Therefore, when we take the divergence of this stress tensor we obtain the
Navier-Stokes equation:
\begin{gather*}
    \rho\DDt{\uvec} = \rho\bs{F} - \grad p + \mu\left[ \grad^2 \uvec +
    \frac{1}{3}\grad \left(\grad \cdot \uvec\right)\right]
\end{gather*}
Of course, when working in an incompressible framework (i.e. $\grad\cdot\uvec =
0$), we have that part of the diffusive term disappears from the equation,
resulting in the commonly used equation:
\begin{gather}
    \DDt{\uvec} = \bs{F} - \frac{1}{\rho_0}\grad p + \nu\grad^2 \uvec
    \label{eq:NS}
\end{gather}
Additional terms are included in this equation as necessary to model relevant
physics of various fluid systems. For example, if in a rotating frame we include
the coriolis force $2\Omega(\bs{e}_{\Omega} \times \uvec)$, if some component of
the fluid is stratified we need some buoyancy forcing $T/N^2\bs{e}_z$. And most
relevant, there might be magnetic forces which affect the fluid, in which case
we obtain the MHD equations. 

\subsection{Vorticity equation}

Vorticity is a quantity related to the fluid field which can be very important
to the scientific study of fluid dynamics. The vorticity is obtained by taking
the curl of the velocity field. 
\begin{gather*}
    \bs{\omega} = \grad \times \uvec
\end{gather*}
The vorticity has an evolution-advection equation just as the velocity field
does, and in fact the vorticity equation is obtained by taking the curl of the
Navier-Stokes equations.

\begin{gather*}
    \grad\times\eqref{eq:NS}\\
    \DDt{\vort} =  \left(\vort\cdot\grad\right)\uvec +
    \vort\left(\grad\cdot\uvec\right) + \grad\times\F -
    \frac{1}{\rho^2}\grad\rho\times\grad p + 
    \nu\grad^2\vort 
\end{gather*}

If the flow is incompressible, one of the vortex stretching terms disappears.
Generally, the first two right hand terms are vortex stretching/tilting/speed-up
terms. Then the pressure and density gradient cross product is the baroclinicity
term, the curl of $\F$ is the forcing of vorticity, and finally, we have a
viscous diffusion of vorticity which behaves similarly to the diffusion of
velocity. 


Baroclinicity is perhaps the most unintuitive term in this equation, and it
simply represents the creation of rotation in the fluid when there is a
disalignment between the pressure and density gradients in the fluid. 

Some fluid dynamicists prefer to study the vorticity equation, especially for
rotating flows where voricites and cyclones are common phenomenon in the flow
field. 

\subsection{Rotation}

In the presence of rotation, the coriolis force becomes relevant as the motion
of a fluid particle is deflected due to the rotation of the cordinate frame.
That is, our equations are modified such that, 
\begin{gather*}
    \ppt{\bs{q}}_F = \ppt{\bs{q}}_R + \bs{\Omega}\times \bs{q} -
    \bs{\Omega}^2\bs{R}
\end{gather*}

This also introduces an additional term to the vorticity equation which looks
like, $+\left(2\bs{\Omega}\cdot\grad\right)\uvec$.
