\section{Billant \& Chomaz Papers}
    \subsection{Experimental evidence for a new instability of a
    vertical columnar vortex pair in a strongly
    stratified fluid (2000)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The first paper in a series of papers by Billant and Chomaz describing
        and investigating the properties of the so called ``zigzag'' instability
        present in the Lamb-Chaplygin vortex pair (a counterrotating vortex dipole). 
        \item This paper demonstrated the existence of such an instability from
        experimental findings at sufficient stratification. For insufficient
        stratification $Fr \ge 0.2 \pm 0.01$, the ellipitcal instability appears to
        be the dominant instability and after its gravitational collapse, the vortex
        pair appears to irregularly zigzag into layer formation. 
        \item From what can be observed from the zigzag instability is that it
        doesn't perturb the horizontal cross-section structure of the vortex column,
        only its vertical structure. It is positted that this phenomenon may be
        responsible for the layering phenomenon demonstrated in many stratified
        flows. 
        \item Over a long enough time frame the original vortex pair column ends up
        divided into pancake dipole segments in the vertical direction, obtaining
        what is usually described as pancake eddies in the flow. 
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Self-similarity of strongly stratified inviscid flows (2001)}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Posits the scaling of an intrinsic vertical length scale of strongly
        stratified flows, $l_z \propto U/N$. 
        \item Third paper which describes the ``Zig-Zag'' instability. Two previous
        papers conducted linear stability analysis of the instability. 
        \item Zig-zag instability is self-similar with respect to $k_zU/N$ which
        implies that the dominant vertical wavenumber of the flow is proportional to
        $Fr$. 
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Three-dimensional stability of vertical columnar vortex pair in a
    stratified fluid}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item This paper conducted a numerical stability analysis on the linearized
        equations using mean-pertubation flow separation. They found for flows
        with sufficient stratification that the primary instability of the
        counterrotating vortex pair was the ``zig-zag'' instability in which the
        entire vortex column was destabilized and oscillationed ide to side with a
        typical scale height, later found to be proportional to the froude number.
        For insufficient stratification, the elliptical instability was the dominant
        instabtility. 
        \item Among their findings is the approximate scaling that the root mean
        squared $u_z' \propto
        1/Fr$ and $p' \propto Fr$ (normalized by the rms horizontal velocity).
        Furthermore, these numerical findings for the growth rate of the zig-zag
        instability concur with the experimental results
        within reasonable error. 
        \item Their nondimensionalization involved 
        \begin{gather*}
            Fr = \frac{U_{\text{prop}}}{NR}
        \end{gather*}
        where $U_{\text{prop}}$ is the propagation speed of the vortex pair, and $R$
        is given by the dipole radius. This is similar to the non-dimensionalization
        from Chini et al, in which the unit velocity and lengthscale are given by
        the typical horizontal flow (i.e. horizontal forcing which is order 1 in
        both $U$ and $L$). 
    \end{itemize}


\section{Hattori \& Hirota Papers}
    \subsection{Stability of two-dimensional Taylor-Green vortices in rotating
    stratified fluids (2023)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conducted a local stability analysis as well as DNS and analyzed the
        data using modal stability analysis. 
        \item Linear Stability analysis is conducted on a linearized and inviscid
        version of the governing equations.
        \item Both the DNS and LSA begin with a base flow composed of Taylor-Green
        vortices, which are arranged in a grid lattice. 
        \item 5 instabilities are identified from the LSA, each with a different
        mechanism and different instability/resonance conditions. 
        \item Linear Stability analysis found that the pure hyperbolic instability
        is often the fastest growing istability as also the most realizable.
        Variation of the input rossby and froude numbers reveals characteristics of
        other secondary instabilities which vary with vertical wavenumber, and
        radius from vortex centers (as well as input parameters). 
    \end{itemize}

\section{Miyazaki and Fukumoto}
    \subsection{Three‚Äêdimensional instability of strained vortices in a stably
    stratified fluid (1992)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This paper conducts a linear stability analysis of ``unbounded
        strained vortices''. The linear stability analysis is derived analytically
        and then solved numerically by a floquet problem. The primary investigation
        is into the elliptical instability of ``Pierrehumbertt type''. Two other
        instability modes are noted which depend distinctly on the buoyancy
        frequency $N$.

        \item Developed a multiscale model for strongly stratified flows wherein an
        aspect ratio $\alpha$ is used to describe scale separation of horizontal and
        vertical motions recovering that $l_z \propto Fr$ as posited by
        %\cite{BillantChomaz2001}.
